CS-465 Full Stack Development I
**Overview**

This project refactors the Travlr Getaways travel website into a Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture using Express .js and the Handlebars (HBS) templating engine. It converts a static HTML site into dynamic templates that render JSON-style data within views, establishing the foundation for later full-stack integration.

**Features**

MVC Architecture: Organized folders for routes, controllers, and views

Routing & Controllers: /travel and /travel/list routes handled by traveler.js controller

Templating: Handlebars layout, partials (_header, _footer), and helpers (currency, date, year)

Dynamic Rendering: Trip data displayed from a sample JSON object via travel-list.hbs

Static Assets: CSS styling and image placeholders for trip packages
